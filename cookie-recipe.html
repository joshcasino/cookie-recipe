  <h3> History of cookies </h3>
  <p>Most people don't know the complicated past of the cookie. <br> More than half of the cookies baked at home are chocolate chip cookies. <br>
  The chocolate chip cookie was invented in 1930 at the Toll House Inn by Ruth Graves Wakefield, <br> resulted when she chopped a semi-sweet chocolate bar into small bits and added it to a traditional colonial butter drop cookie recipe

  <p>This recipe is from my dad and they are a favorite among friends and family.
    The secret ingredient is the coconut! <em>Be warned</em>, these will fly off of the plate!</p>
